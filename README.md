# flask_hello_world
Simple Flask web app for testing deployment and stuff.

Servers only one purpose... to be of hello world

## How I made it

First I created a simple Flask app and tested it locally using this [tutorial]()
For deployment I followed the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/6p7GBfHgJq8).
To create basic mannual connection with github I followed this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/4sTZN15J33A).

## Future

Tasks for me are.
- Test how much traffic/requests/runnint time can the free tier on pythonanywhere.com handle.
- Try to automate source-code updates from GitHub using GitHub actions and others.
- Try some other (paid) options with purchasing part of cloud server running it there (viz this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/vfZgHX5ttsY) and others)
- Try some possibilities of having the free python server accessible from my own domain name.
